# This is repo on Browser use, its an open source tool to automate browser task 
# Browser internally uses Playwrite so we need to work on that too https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
# we are going to edit it and tailor it to make it a automatic agent tool to test all features and things that are available on a website 
# IMPORTANT: The agent should vist and test all the features available recursively.

# Things to do
1. Edit browser use agent such that it returns network data using Playwrite, and send it out. 
2. Edit browser use to make it stream the entire activity to a client (Frame by Frame) lets take it around 15fps 
3. Edit browser use to announce all the Features or intrative elements it discovered and recursively with a user specified depth it should traverse all features and return a GRAPH


[server.py](mdc:server.py) will be the main entry point for the entire tester applicaion. So any client will connect to a socket via this server and interally server can use Browser use to go feature by feature and get all things tested, So even Browser use should announce what happened when a feature was intracted with. 

# Code rules 
1. Use Object orinterd progamming for easy understanding 
2. Write comments
3. Create model or class files if needed so, each Class can be its own seperate file inside a Folder

# Framework 
Mainly for [server.py](mdc:server.py)
Use Fast-api with sockets and web-rpc if needed for streaming real time video of the browser in 15fps
